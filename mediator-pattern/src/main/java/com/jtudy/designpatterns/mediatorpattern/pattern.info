- Mediator pattern is used to reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes. 
- This pattern provides a mediator class which normally handles all the communications between different classes and supports easy maintenance of the code by loose coupling. 
- Mediator pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

Facade (185) differs from Mediator in that it abstracts a subsystem of objects to provide a more convenient interface. 
Its protocol is unidirectional; that is, Facade objects make requests of the subsystem classes but not vice versa. 
In contrast, Mediator enables cooperative behavior that colleague objects don't or can't provide, and the protocol is multidirectional.

And about the definition:
Facade's Type: Structural
Mediator's Type: Behavioral
Facade is more concerned about the components contained in the unified interface, and mediator concern how a set of objects interact.
