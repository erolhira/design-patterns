- Composite Pattern is in the category of STRUCTURAL PATTERN.
- Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system.

NOTES:
- Facade design pattern is more like a helper for client applications, it doesn’t hide subsystem interfaces from the client. 
Whether to use Facade or not is completely dependent on client code.
- Facade design pattern can be applied at any point of development, usually when the number of interfaces grow and system gets complex.
- Subsystem interfaces are not aware of Facade and they shouldn’t have any reference of the Facade interface.
- Facade design pattern should be applied for similar kind of interfaces, 
its purpose is to provide a single interface rather than multiple interfaces that does the similar kind of jobs.
- We can use Factory pattern with Facade to provide better interface to client systems.
